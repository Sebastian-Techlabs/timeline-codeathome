    This is the first of three Methodical Sessions (**LIVE**), which you can join during the #codeathome Bootcamp.
    During our Live Sessions, we will invite speakers from various fields to give an inspirational talk about a relevant topic such as remote working or women in tech.
    More information will follow soon...

    *Don't worry if you cannot attend! We will record the session and share it afterwards, you will find it in the **[Media Page](https://codeathome.techlabs.org/media)***
