    This was the first of three remote live social events you can attend. The goal of our social events is to foster a strong community spirit and have some fun together!
    During this event, you got to know your fellow techies in a fun speed dating, got unique insights in an "Ask Your Mentor Anything" Q&A and proof your artistic skills.
