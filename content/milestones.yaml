    Now it is the time to choose if you want to learn Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Web Development or
    User Experience Design.

    We will post instructions how to choose your track in the Kick-Off Session.

    Please complete the following steps to choose your track:

    1. Create an account at [edyoucated](https://bln.techlabs.org/JOINEDY): [**bln.techlabs.org/JOINEDY**](https://bln.techlabs.org/JOINEDY)
    1. After logging in, choose **TechLabs Berlin**.
    1. Complete the track personalization survey.
    1. Back at edyoucated, confirm that you finished the survey.

    After we've received all of your choices, we will evaluate your answers in the track personalization survey.
    Then we will assign you to a track on edyoucated and you can start learning. Please allow some time between
    you completing the survey and the track assignment as this process involves some manual steps. We will send you a
    message on Slack as soon as you can access your track material on edyoucated.

    You can apply for TechLabs Berlin **until Saturday**. All you need to do is to complete the application
    form linked below.

    Please note that the survey consists of several questions, some of them require you to reflect on yourself.
    This is intentional and ensures that we can build a community of very smart and motivated learners.
    In that way you can be sure that your learning experience will be awesome and that you'll all have a great time.
    On the other hand, it also means you'll have to invest 20 to 30 minutes. But it'll be worth it, we promise!

    You did some nice work and now is the time to show it off! After you've
    finished your implementation, you will officially submit your project to us
    for review.

    Each team has to submit an **elevator pitch** in which you present your project and your results. The elevator pitch
    should be kept relatively short (between 2-5 mins) and highlight the most important aspects of your idea.
    In order to give you an impression of what an elevator pitch could look like and which points you should address,
    we've prepared a [small demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pagQbB54jmMGk8yhwa-Aj8THDDTg24rq/view?usp=sharing)
    for you. The tool we used for this is called [Loom](https://loom.com)

    These are the main points you should cover in your video:

    1. **The problem you found**: which project idea did you have? What problem should be solved or which question should be answered?

    2. **Your solution**: What is your solution to the problem? What results have you achieved?

    3. A **walkthrough-style demo** of the prototype

    4. What **knowledge** you used you learned with TechLabs

    5. **Success Story**: what are you happy with? What are your greatest personal moments of success? What were the biggest challenges? In which direction would you further extend your prototype?

    In addition, we would like you to submit a **link to your GitHub repository** along with a *README* which outlines
    what steps are needed to operate the prototype. If in any way possible, please have a look how you can **deploy**
    your solution on a service such as Heroku to make it publicly available. This is not only beneficial for us but also
    for you, since you can directly refer to your work later on when you want to show it off to anyone.

    The Project Submission Form must be submitted **once per project team**.
