    You can apply for TechLabs Berlin **until Saturday**. All you need to do is to complete the application
    form linked below.

    Please note that the survey consists of several questions, some of them require you to reflect on yourself.
    This is intentional and ensures that we can build a community of very smart and motivated learners.
    In that way you can be sure that your learning experience will be awesome and that you'll all have a great time.
    On the other hand, it also means you'll have to invest 20 to 30 minutes. But it'll be worth it, we promise!
