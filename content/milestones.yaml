    You did some nice work and now is the time to show off! After you've finished your project, today you will officially submit it to us for review.

    **The deadline for submitting your project is the 31th October 2020, 11 PM Cest!**

    **Submit your project via our Submission Typeform.**

    There you can also add a presentation video, powerpoint, demo, prototype, etc. (depending on your solution). You can also submit aÂ **link to your GitHub repository.** This is not only beneficial for us but also for you, since you can directly refer to your work later on when you want to show it off to anyone.
    If you have any further questions we encourage you to read carefully our Project Guide including **[the Submission notion page](https://www.notion.so/techlabs/codeathome-Project-Submission-ebdc9c9a1ac74c83b295d256a835118e)**.

    The Project Submission Typeform must be submitted by **every team member**.
