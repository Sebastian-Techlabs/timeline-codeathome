  questions:
  - title: What tools do I need? How do I get them?
    content: |
      - We use Slack to stay in touch with each other. 
  - title: How do I keep up-to-date?
    content: |
      Please make sure to keep track of the `#codeathome_announcements` channel in Slack. It's a good idea to download
      the Slack desktop and mobile apps to get notified of new messages in this channel. We don't expect you to monitor
      it 24/7 but you should check it regularly.
  - title: How can I get access to edyoucated?
    content: |
      We will provide instructions to join edyoucated in our Kick-Off event.
  - title: Is there an attendance requirement for meetings?
    content: |
      We don't have an attendance requirement, but one of the key aspects of TechLabs is a community which will help you learn and build something together. This means that we strongly recommend participating in as many community events as you can.

  questions:
 
  - title: Is there a certificate at the end of the course?
    content: |
      Yes, if you finish the course successfully, you will get the TechLabs Digital Shaper Certificate.

      Successfully completed means that:

      - You've completed your personalized learning track
      - You've participated in and submitted your project
      - You wrote a summary of your project's use case including problem and solution statements to make your work visible

      Don't worry, we will assist you with each of those tasks.
  - title: How many working hours should I spend per week?
    content: |
      You should be able to reserve about 5 to 10 hours of continuous working time per week for TechLabs. The amount
      of time needed depends on the semester phase. There will be weeks in which you will spend less time and some where
      you are encouraged to work more, for example before submitting your project.
  - title: Can I work on more than one track?
    content: |
      As our goal is to facilitate collaboration among our participants, taking more than one course or project
      at a time does not make much sense. You are of course free to learn other topics besides your TechLabs tracks
      and to contribute everything you know to your project.

- title: Projects
  questions:
  - title: How big are the teams in the final team projects?
    content: |
      This depends on the type and scope of your project. If you choose to work on a problem that encompasses multiple
      problem domains (such as building a web application for data visualization), you will need to work together with
      more participants, potentially.

      Ususally project groups consist of three to five people.
